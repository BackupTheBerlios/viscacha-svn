== 1 == Installation ==

Warning: Since 0.8 RC7 we provide separate packages for installation
         and update. Please use the package which contains "install"
         in the name for an installation only.

1. Download the installation package from the Viscacha homepage!
2. Upload all files per ftp onto your server.
3. Call the "install/" directory in the Viscacha-root-directory and
   follow the steps.
4. You have a "fresh" Viscacha-Installation on your server.

Note: More information on how to set up the CHMODs you can get while
      installing the application. In the ACP you can also see a more
      detailed list of the required CHMODs.
