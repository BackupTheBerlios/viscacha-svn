== Preambel ==

This is the second public release of Viscacha (0.8). Some of the Feature
are missing, but I am working to complete these features for version 0.9.
You can commit bugs and suggestions to the bugtracker (see below) and I 
will check this entries and fix or implement them in most cases.

there can occur some problems. This is version 0.8 and not 1.0. Until 
version 1.0 is released there will be some major changes that can affect 
the compatibility and my result in lost data. Plugins and Components are 
currently on the newest state, but there can be some minor changes in the
API of plugins and components. All available hooks of the plugin system you
can find in the file hooks.txt. If there is a hook missing, please contact 
the support and we will implement this hook into the next version of Viscacha.

Installation will be available on your server.
